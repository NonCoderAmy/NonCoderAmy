### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**NonCoderAmy/NonCoderAmy** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

### Iâ€™m currently working on all things related to hiring in Italy
### Iâ€™m currently learning about all of our PS SPEED Capabilities in cross-functional training
### Pronouns: She/Her
### Fun fact: In 2009 I had a very rare injury called a Monteggia fracture (dislocated radius and ulna snapped in half) which severed a nerve.  I lived with a bionic plate and 50% funtion in my left hand for 11 years.  Then in 2020 and 2021 I had my metal plate removed and had two tendon transfers.  After the 2 tendon transfers and a year of occuptional therapy, I gained about 30% more functionality by relearning how to use my hand with different tendons.
