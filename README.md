### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### Iâ€™m a recruiter currently working on all things related to PS hiring in Italy
### Iâ€™m currently learning about all of our PS SPEED Capabilities in cross-functional training
### Pronouns: She/Her
### Fun facts: 
<ul>
<li>I love to travel and my most recent trip was to Bali, Indonesia. It was an amazing trip despite a few blips.</li>
<li>I love all things related to food.  I cook, I grow my own vegetables, and of course...I eat.</li>
<li>I foster dogs and puppies. I had had 15 fosters and foster failed 2 of them (I adopted them).</li>
<li>I'm not an athlete and have never been injured in a car accident, but somehow I have managed to have 5 major surgeries (4 arm repair and reconstruction and 1 spinal), 1 severed nerve, 2 metal plates, 2 tendon transfers and had to relearn how to use my left hand. I'm special like that :)</li>
